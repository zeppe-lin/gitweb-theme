OVERVIEW

	This directory contains gitweb-theme, an alternative theme for gitweb.

	This theme is basically a fork of:

		https://github.com/kogakure/gitweb-theme

	with CSS modifications of:

		http://git.linaro.org/infrastructure/gitweb-linaro-theme.git

	What has changed are colors, fonts, and the logos.  The following
	files have been removed: README.markdown, setup.

INSTALL

	The installation of this stylesheet is very easy.  Just copy the
	following files to the directory where gitweb static files is located
	(usually /usr/share/gitweb):

		sudo cp -f git-favicon.png git-logo.png gitweb.css \
			/usr/share/gitweb/static/

	Be aware that this command will overwrite the original files!  So,
	make sure you have made a backup.

LICENSE

	Same as the gitweb-theme upstream, MIT license.
