OVERVIEW

	This directory contains gitweb-theme, an alternative theme for gitweb.

	This theme is basically a fork of:

		https://github.com/kogakure/gitweb-theme

	with CSS modifications of:

		http://git.linaro.org/infrastructure/gitweb-linaro-theme.git

	What has changed are colors, fonts, and the logos.  The following
	files have been removed: README.markdown, setup.

INSTALL

	The installation of this stylesheet is very easy:

		make install

	This command will overwrite the following files in /usr/share/gitweb:

		* static/git-favicon.png
		* static/git-logo.png
		* static/gitweb.js

	So, make sure you have made backup!

	If /usr/share/gitweb is not the directory where gitweb is located,
	then pass the directory to the make(1) with the GITWEBDIR option.
	Example:

		make GITWEBDIR=/root/usr/share/gitweb install

LICENSE

	Same as the gitweb-theme upstream, MIT license.

End of file.
